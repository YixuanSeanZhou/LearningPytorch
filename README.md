# Learning Pytorch

In this repo, I would follow the book [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf) to take a step back and re-learn PyTorch. 

This learning process is to better prepare myself to conduct a research with Jinjie and Prof. Saab next quarter to take look at the problem of how to compress a trained deep neural net.
